description: Execute research and business validation workflow using specialized agents.
loop: outer
# Loop Classification: OUTER LOOP
# This command is part of the outer loop (planning/design phase). It conducts research
# and business validation to inform feature design and planning decisions.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Light Mode Check

**IMPORTANT**: First check if this project is in light mode:

```bash
# Check for light mode marker
if [ -f ".flowspec-light-mode" ]; then
  echo "LIGHT MODE DETECTED"
  # Stop here - research is skipped in light mode
else
  echo "FULL MODE - Proceeding with research"
  # Continue with standard research workflow
fi
```

**If `.flowspec-light-mode` exists**, inform the user and DO NOT proceed:

```text
[i] This project is in Light Mode - /flow:research is SKIPPED

Light mode provides a streamlined ~60% faster workflow by skipping the research
phase. This is appropriate for medium-complexity features (4-6/10).

Your options:
  1. Run /flow:plan to proceed directly to planning
  2. To enable research, delete .flowspec-light-mode and use full mode
     (See docs/guides/when-to-use-light-mode.md for upgrade instructions)

Current workflow path: Specified -> Planned (skipping Researched)
```

**If NOT in light mode**, continue with the standard research workflow below.

## Execution Instructions

This command orchestrates comprehensive research and business validation using two specialized agents working sequentially.

**For /flow:research**: Required input state is `workflow:Specified`. Output state will be `workflow:Researched`.

If the task doesn't have the required workflow state, inform the user:
- If task needs specification first: suggest running `/flow:specify`
- If research needs to be done before specification: explain that this violates the workflow

### Extended Thinking Mode

> **[~] Megathink**: Comprehensive research requires deep analysis across multiple dimensions. Apply extended thinking to:
> - Technology landscape and emerging trends
> - Competitive positioning and market dynamics
> - Long-term feasibility and risk assessment
> - Integration options and architectural implications

**IMPORTANT: Before starting, check for existing research-related tasks:**

```bash
# Session-start: bv agent brief
mkdir -p /tmp/bv-brief
bv -agent-brief /tmp/bv-brief 2>/dev/null && cat /tmp/bv-brief/brief.md 2>/dev/null

# Semantic search for related existing research
bv -search "$ARGUMENTS" -robot-search 2>/dev/null

# Check for duplicate research tasks
bv -robot-suggest 2>/dev/null

# Search for research tasks
backlog search "research" --plain
backlog search "$ARGUMENTS" --plain

# List all research tasks (beads-rust preferred, backlog as fallback)
br ready
backlog task list -l research --plain
```

Review any existing tasks before proceeding. If relevant tasks exist, coordinate with them or update them instead of duplicating work.

### Creating Business Validation Tasks

For each topic requiring business validation, create a validation task in backlog:

```bash
TASK_ID=$(br create \
  --title="Business Validation: [TOPIC]" \
  --type=task \
  --priority=2 \
  -l "validation,business" \
  -d "WHAT: Business viability and strategic fit assessment for [TOPIC]

```

### Final Output

Consolidate both reports into a comprehensive research and validation package that enables informed decision-making.

```bash
# After research completes, check impact and graph analysis
bv -robot-insights 2>/dev/null
bv -robot-alerts 2>/dev/null
```

### [!] MANDATORY: Design->Implement Workflow

**This is a DESIGN command. Research tasks MUST create implementation tasks before completion.**

After the research and business validation agents complete their work:

1. **Create implementation tasks** based on research findings and recommendations:
   ```bash
   # Create tasks from research recommendations using WHAT-WHY-HOW style
   TASK_ID=$(br create \
     --title="Implement [Recommended Solution]" \
     --type=task \
     --priority=2 \
     -l "implement,research-followup" \
     -d "WHAT: Implement solution recommended in research report

WHY: Research validated [business case / feasibility / market fit] - now proceeding to implementation

HOW: [recommended approach from research findings - technology, architecture, patterns]

Refs: docs/research/<topic>-findings.md, docs/prd/<feature>.md" \
     --silent)

   # Set acceptance criteria on the created issue
   br update "$TASK_ID" --acceptance-criteria $'- [ ] Implement approach recommended in research report\n- [ ] Address feasibility concerns identified in validation\n- [ ] Monitor metrics defined in business case'

   TASK_ID=$(br create \
     --title="Technical Spike: [Validate Key Assumption]" \
     --type=task \
     --priority=2 \
     -l "spike,research-followup" \
     -d "WHAT: Validate critical assumption identified in research report

WHY: Assumption X must be confirmed before full implementation - de-risk approach

HOW: Timeboxed experiment or prototype to validate feasibility

Refs: docs/research/<topic>-findings.md" \
     --silent)

   # Set acceptance criteria on the created issue
   br update "$TASK_ID" --acceptance-criteria $'- [ ] Assumption X validated or disproved with evidence\n- [ ] Findings documented and implementation plan updated'
   ```

2. **Update research task notes** with follow-up references:
   ```bash
   backlog task edit <research-task-id> --append-notes $'Research Outcome: Go/No-Go/Proceed with Caution\n\nFollow-up Implementation Tasks:\n- task-XXX: Implement recommended solution\n- task-YYY: Validation spike for assumption A'
   ```

3. **Only then mark the research task as Done**

**Research without actionable follow-up tasks provides no value. Every research effort must produce implementation direction.**

**Note**: If research concludes with "No-Go" recommendation, create a documentation task to record the decision and rationale for future reference.

## Post-Completion: Emit Workflow Event

After successfully completing this command (research and validation reports generated), emit the workflow event:

```bash
flowspec hooks emit research.completed \
  --spec-id "$FEATURE_ID" \
  --task-id "$TASK_ID" \
  -f docs/research/$FEATURE_ID-research.md \
  -f docs/research/$FEATURE_ID-validation.md
```

Replace `$FEATURE_ID` with the feature name/identifier and `$TASK_ID` with the backlog task ID if available.

This triggers any configured hooks in `.flowspec/hooks/hooks.yaml` (e.g., notifications, quality gates).
